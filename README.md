Project created in Unreal Engine 5.3

Attempt to create a 2D top-down game demo using Unreal Engine 5.3
Purpose of project was to apply what we learned in other courses and apply that knowledge to a project. The goal was not to successfully complete an application, but to demonstrate acquired skills regardless of success or failure of the project. Which is why I completed the class with an B+ despite biting off more than I could chew on my project in an 8 week long class.
